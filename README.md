# cincyfp_kaggle_201701

This contains some example implementations for the Kaggle competition
done at the CincyFP meeting on January 10th, 2016.
See <https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/uci-wine-quality-dataset> to
download the data files.

## R

See `example.R` in the `R` directory.  This uses
the [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html)
library to fit a decision tree to the data.

For those not familiar with R, you'll probably need to first run:

```r
install.packages("rpart")
```
